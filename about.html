        <!-- <h1>About me</h1> -->
          <p>My whole life, I have been interested in creating things. When I was little, a ball peen hammer was the centerpiece of my stuffed animal collection. I took it everywhere because you never know when you will run into a nail that needs some hammering. Eventually, long after putting nails in all sorts of places around my house, I graduated to a tool that is a little more complicated than a hammer: a 3D printer. I was taking an intro to engineering course in high school when I was first exposed to 3D modeling and printing. I was fascinated and soon was spending all my study halls in that classroom, playing with the printers. Honestly, it still blows my mind that I can design something on the computer and a few hours later hold it in my hand. Since high school, I have learned a lot more about engineering and manufacturing and done my fair share of projects. While I have done a lot of projects on my own (see my project page for details), I also enjoy working with other people. During my internships I had the privilege to work with some very talented people and did my best to learn as much from them as possible. At my internship in Volvo, I worked with a casting expert to redesign a part that would be easier for the workers to assemble on the trucks, while still passing their rigorous FEA. During my Coop with Gleason I worked closely with my team in engineering in addition to people on the factory floor. With their advice, I designed parts and systems that were shipped out to individual customers in addition to ones that went into manufacturing for an entire line of machines. I am most proud of the cast part I designed to replace two weldments in one of the machines. Both weldments cost $1000 to produce and my part was quoted at $250. At home, I try to branch out a little bit. I am still creating and solving problems, but I have been trying to diversify my skills. I picked up Blender, a rendering software, to try to learn a different style of designing and have a place to make high quality renderings of my projects. One of those projects was a table I made that uses the principles of tensegrity to stand up. I also have been working on my web design, but as you can see, I still have a ways to go. Also, I taught myself some c++ and am in the process of making a 3D printed and automated car using ROS. ___FINAL SENTENCE__

        <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
          <h2>Q1: How do I pronounce your name?</h2>
          <p>A: Gaetan is pronounced like a "gate" in the shape of an "N. "Gate"-"N".  My last name, Foisy, rhymes with "noisy". </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Q2: Why did you pick engineering?</h2>
          <p>A: The short answer is that I enjoy solving tough problems that force me to grow in some way (this is one of the reasons I made this website). My parents always knew I was going to end up and engineer, but I only realized it when I took an engineering class in high school. The Venn-diagram of my interests and what that class covered would have been two circles perfectly overlapping each other. Itâ€™s no surprise that I spent the majority of my study halls in that classroom and the shop next door. </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Q3: What makes you stand out?</h2>
          <p>A: I have lots of experience making parts with CAD and then manufacturing them myself. This has given me the perspective of both designer and manufacturer, and when I design, I create solutions that work and are easy to manufacture. I also am </p>
