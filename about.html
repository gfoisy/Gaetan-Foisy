           <p>Covid-19 stole my summer internship, so I decided to use that time to learn the basics of at least one programming language. I ended up learning basic C++, html, CSS, and some JavaScript. I mention this because I think it is a good example of what type of person I am. Before the shutdown, I only knew how to work with Matlab and felt like my ignorance of programming was one of my weaknesses, so I started fixing it. Now, I have a better understanding of the inner workings of programming, and I can contribute when people are talking about their projects. Or at least, I can follow along with what they are doing. In addition, learning C++ has let me start to add automation to my designs, which is extremely fun. Eventually, I want to fill my house with over-engineered gadgets that do everything for me, starting with a <a href="./projects/project-robotic_light.html">robotic desk light.</a>
          </p>

          <p>As you go through the projects on my site, you may notice the underlying goal behind all of them (aside from being fun to make). Each project I do is to test my abilities and teach me new skills. At the end of the day, I really like making stuff and I want to do it to the best of my abilities.

          <h2>Q1: How do I pronounce your name?</h2>
          <p>A: Gaetan is pronounced like a "gate" in the shape of an "N. "Gate"-"N".  My last name (Foisy) rhymes with "noisy". </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Q2: Why did you pick engineering?</h2>
          <p>A: The short answer is that I enjoy solving tough problems that force me to grow in some way (this is one of the reasons I made this website). My parents always knew I was going to end up and engineer, but I only realized it when I took an engineering class in high school. The Venn-diagram of my interests and what that class covered were two circles perfectly overlapping each other. Itâ€™s no surprise that I spent the majority of my study halls in that classroom and the shop next door. </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Q3: What is your favorite color?</h2>
          <p>A: Green. Can you tell?
