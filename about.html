           <p><strong class="initialWords">When covid hit, I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands.</strong> I decided that I was going to spend it working on myself and that I was going to use it to learn the basics of at least a programming language. I ended up learning basic Python, html, CSS, and some JavaScript. Before the shutdown, I only knew how to work with Matlab and felt like my ignorance of programming was one of my weaknesses, so I started taking steps towards fixing it. Now, I have a better understanding of the inner workings of programming, and I can contribute when people are talking about their projects. Or at least, I can follow along with what they are doing. Additionally, I was able to use my crappy 3D printed to build a better 3D printer (kind of a theme with me). I also started working on many of the projects on this site. Eventually, I want to fill my house with over-engineered gadgets that do everything for me, but that’s a story for another day.

          <p>As you go through the projects on my site, you may notice the underlying goal behind all of them (aside from being fun to make). Most projects for me to try something new, learn some new skills, and maybe build a tool or two. At the end of the day, I really like making stuff and I want to do it to the best of my abilities.

          <h2>Q1: How do I pronounce your name?</h2>
          <p>A: Gaetan is pronounced like a "gate" in the shape of an "N. "Gate"-"N".  My last name (Foisy) rhymes with "noisy". </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Q2: Why did you pick engineering?</h2>
          <p>A: The short answer is that I enjoy solving tough problems that force me to grow in some way (this is one of the reasons I made this website). My parents always knew I was going to end up an engineer, but I only realized it when I took an engineering class in high school. The Venn-diagram of my interests and what that class covered were two circles perfectly overlapping each other. It’s no surprise that I spent the majority of my study halls in that classroom and the shop next door. </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Q3: What is your favorite color?</h2>
          <p>A: Purple. Or green. And red is pretty cool too.
          </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Q4: Do you have any advice for your younger self?</h2>
          <p>A: Just do it. It is always good to strive for perfection, but sometimes "done" is the best thing a project can be.
          </p>
