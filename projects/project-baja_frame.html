      <p><strong class="initialWords"> In previous years our frame wasn’t square.</strong> As a driver, this bothered me because it would cause the car to turn more in one direction than the other. As the leader of the frame team, this bothered me because an asymmetric car is a car that is not machined to tolerance. This makes my FEA much less reliable. But at the end of the day, this bothered me because I take pride in my work and I wanted “my” frame to be SQUARE. So, I devised a plan.</p>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>In previous years, the first thing we did was to manufacture the tubes for the firewall, then bolt them down to the welding table. The trouble is, it’s hard to accurately measure tubing, much less make small adjustments while keeping everything else in place. We would usually end up with a half inch tolerance. I realized that if I could precisely manufacture a fixture to hold the tubes in the right position, then manufacturing would be a breeze. So, I took a piece of plywood and used a cnc router to drill holes in it. Then, I cut up some pvc pipes that would act like pegs and inserted them into the holes. This let me position the firewall’s tubes with high accuracy as well as held them in place when I welded.

    <div class= "words">
    <p>This method took our tolerance down from a half inch to a sixteenth, so of course we also wanted to use it for the footbox. For this, I needed to have the plywood support a 3-dimensional structure. All it took was a quick chat with the team’s advisor, some clever cuts, and boom: we had a square footbox.
