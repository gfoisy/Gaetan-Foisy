      <p><strong class="initialWords">I love 3D printing, but it has some drawbacks.</strong>  For example, a few years ago I designed a car mount for my phone and printed it out of PLA. All it took was one sunny day for it to melt beyond recognition. Also, I still haven’t gotten my hands on a reliable way of performing FEA for a 3d printed part. Every printer prints differently and don’t get me started on infill. For these reasons and many more, I have been intersted in casting parts out of hard plastic or resin for a while, and recently decided that it was the right time to give it a shot.

    <div class= "words">
      <p>It may be the right time to give casting a shot, but I live in an apartment, so it took some work to make the right place happen at the right time. The only logical solution was to make a fume hood.

      <h3 class="phototag">My window with the air duct in place. I have a plug (seen below) so that I can close it up without having to take everything apart.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>The fume hood itself was pretty easy to make, all I needed to do was find a material to make a box that is strong and cheap. The real problem was how to get the fumes out the window without them blowing back in. My solution was to cut a hole in some insulation, mount a 3D printed port-hole on it and squish it underneath my window. I used weatherstripping to stop the air from getting in the cracks, that way I can leave it in all the time. The remaining 7x4ft of insulation solved the problem of what material to use for the rest of the fume hood.

    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>Since I embedded magnets into my prints, it is extremely easy to swap out the duct and plug. I added a tongue and groove system to my 3D printed port and plug. It discourages lateral motion and completely stops any and all airflow from going where I don’t want it.

    <div class= "words">
      <p>Now that the fume hood was settled, it was time to start casting! The first thing I tried was a pallet for painting. It was small and easy to model and was an excellent first project. I 3D printed my original piece, sanded it for felt like an hour and then covered it in silicone. The next day, I popped the original out and poured in the resin. It went from clear to completely opaque in about 10 minutes which blew my mind.

      <h3 class="phototag">I was really happy with how the part turned out, however...</h3>
    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>Unfortunately, this pallet doesn’t work. The paint sticks to it and I believe that it is because I didn’t sand it smooth enough. After a quick purchase on Amazon, I didn’t need to make a pallet anymore. All in all, I was pretty happy with this as a first test. The molds worked properly and I didn’t pass out from the fumes. However, the silicone I used to mold my pallet was more expensive than anything else in my process and I wanted to get something useful out of this experiment so I thought up another project.

    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>It is recommended to use silicone when casting resin, but I have a lot of PLA and nobody explicitly told me not to 3D print a mold. Also, I did look into it, and silicone is recommended because of its flexibility. Since I know how to model for casting, I gave it a shot and made a 3-part mold for a stylus holder.

    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>And I have to say, except for the mold melting, it worked better than I expected. I knew that urethane cures with an exothermic reaction, but I didn’t expect it to get hot enough to melt my mold. Fortunately, the end product was fine, but I definitely can’t use a 3D printed mold to mass-produce stylus holders.

    <div class= "words">
      <p>I had a little silicone left, so I put it in the bottom to stop my pen from smashing when I drop it in. Although I still have to be careful: if I drop it too hard it’ll just bounce out.
