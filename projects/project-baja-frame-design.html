      <p><strong class="initialWords">For my year as frame-team lead, I had a few goals in mind. </strong> I wanted my frame to be light, strong, and more reliably manufactured. For more about manufacturing, check out <a class="link-out" href=./project-baja_frame.html>this</a> page.

    <div class= "words">
      <p>In order to make the frame light and strong, I needed accurate FEA. I used NX for analysis because it is great at analysis in addition to being a modeling software. That meant that I didn’t have to keep swapping programs every time I wanted to update my model. Instead of creating a solid model of a frame, I made a wireframe model (a collection of connected lines) and assigned each line the physical properties of the tube it represents. Using lines with the properties of tubing instead of a solid model reduces the time it takes to run the analysis. Where a solid model would take hours, this takes seconds. Baja cars are well suited for this approach because they essentially large truss problems and can be easily analyzed as such. I would not recommend this method for something that isn't a truss, like our uprights.

    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>While this approach to FEA makes sense in theory, it is still a large leap to make when you are designing something as critical as a roll-cage, so I did some tests. When comparing the results from FEA on a solid and detailed model to our wireframe, the results were identical. Unfortunately, in order to compare my FEA to the real car, I had to make the car first.

      <p>Thanks to our updated manufacturing techniques and the quality of NX’s solvers, the strain measured in our tests was between 1% and 8% of what we expected and within our factor of safety.

    <div class= "words">
      <p>After manufacturing, it was time to weight the car. My model was lighter than last year’s CAD model, but welding can add a lot of weight, so I was nervous. Fortunately, my hard work was validated and it was lighter. With a weight of 73.7 lbf, it is actually the lightest frame in UR Baja history. While my ego may want my record to stand, I still can’t wait to see how they beat it!
