    <div class= "words">
      <p>In previous years, the first thing we did was to manufacture the tubes for the firewall. After they were completed, we would bolt them down to the welding table and weld them. The trouble is, it’s hard to accurately measure tubing, much less make small adjustments while keeping everything else in place. That combined with the warping from welding would usually end up causing our firwall to be accurate to about a half inch of tolerence. The first thing I wanted to fix was our fixturing method. If the tubes weren't in the correct position in the first place, they wouldn't be square, no matter how well I welded them.

    <div class= "words">
      <p>
        The solution I settled on was using a CNC router to manufacture our fixture. I took a piece of plywood and used the router to precisely drill holes in it. Then, I cut up some pvc pipes to act like pegs and put them into the holes with about 2 inches sticking out to support the firewall. This not only let me position the components of the firewall with high accuracy, it also held them in place for welding. I had talked to some professional welders at 'Ark and Flame' to get their advice on welding the firewall. With their advice, I was able to seam the firewall with minimal warping.

    <div class= "words">
    <p>This method took our tolerance down from a half inch to a sixteenth, so of course we also wanted to use it for the footbox. For this, I needed to have the plywood support a 3-dimensional structure. All it took was a quick chat with the team’s advisor, some clever cuts, and boom: we had a square footbox.

        <p>With the main parts together, the rest of the pieces went in with minimal issues. We ran some physical tests alongside our FEA in order to validate both our analysis and compare the CAD model with the frame we manufactured. With the tests being accurate from 1.1%-8%, it's official: this is the most accurate frame UR Baja has made yet!
