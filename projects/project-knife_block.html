      <p><strong class="initialWords"> I don’t want to buy a knife block.</strong> What happens if I get more knives than it has spaces? Or if I get a cool knife that doesn’t fit and of the holes? Thankfully, I don’t have to spend $30 on a superfluous knife block when I already spent $450 on a 3D printer.

    <div class= "words">
      <p>As a college student, I need to keep the future in mind when I design. I have no idea what type of kitchen knives I am going to pick up, so I need to design a knife block that can adapt. That is why I made my knife block completely modular.

    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>Other than the location of the magnetic interfaces and an overall design envelope, each section of the block can be fully customized to fit any knife that I happen to purchase (within reason). All I need to do is tweak my template model and print! Also, I designed the magnets to self-align and snap together with a satisfying “click”.

    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>While I only have three knives at this point, I am quite happy with the overall design. Theoretically I could keep adding on modules until it is more of a knife-bookcase than a knife block, but I doubt that will be necessary. If I were to do this again, I would add another magnet to the interface between blocks. It is decently secure with three magnets, but I would feel better with four. The only other thing I would change isn’t a design problem. If I could, I would have stopped myself from opening the window when I printed the parts the first time. The cold night air caused them to warp slightly, but since they work and are a lot of plastic to reprint, I kept them. However, I get a little bit more annoyed every time I look at the uneven top of the block, so I might end up reprinting them someday soon.
