    <div class= "words">
        <p> <strong class="initialWords">So, I decided to make a website. </strong> I am barely literate with html, css and JS, but I had a secret weapon: the internet. Also a friend who is an incredible web developer. I am incredibly grateful for his constructive criticism and bug-fixing the almost unintelligible code I wrote. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image one" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/original-idea.PNG" alt="The first draft of my website">
      <h3 class="phototag">The original idea and layout of my site.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class= "words">
        <p>Originally, the idea behind my site was completely different. I liked this picture and though it would be a good starting point for my design. It made a decent first page, but I didn’t like where it led me when I was trying to come up with ideas for the other pages. Ie: I had no ideas for the other pages. </p>
    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>I decided that I would redo my site and move away from having a single image as my background. It didn’t scale well and I ended up having to jump through a lot of hoops in order to get something I was ok with. Instead, I decided I should put a model of my 3d printer (CR10) on the first page, but not use it as the background. I am a big fan of 3d printing, and I wanted to use this page to show off my 3D modeling talent. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image two" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/3dprinter-draft.PNG" alt="A wireframe of my new website idea with a portion of a 3d printer visable">
      <h3 class="phototag">Fun fact, in an earlier draft of my site, the printer would “print” if you scrolled up and down. This was achieved with a few dozen clever div elements and way too much time. I ended up scrapping it because it refused to scale well and was more trouble than its worth.</h3>
    </div>


    <div class= "words">
      <p>Now that I had my base idea down, I needed a color pallet to work on. I am pretty bad with colors, but my friend had a few good site recommendations and I found my inspiration.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image three" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/color-pallet.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the color pallete I used.">
      <h3 class="phototag">Botanical Hues from design-seeds.com</h3>
    </div>


    <div class= "words">
      <p>I ended up picking a few colors from this pallet and ran with them. </p>
    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>Now, all I had to do was to model my printer and export it Blender to render it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image four" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/color.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the color pallete I used.">
      <h3 class="phototag">blender renders and maybe some prog pictures</h3>
    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>With that finished, I put the assets into my site, and it really started to come together. After finishing the first page, I realized that I had too much empty space, so I rendered some of my other projects and put them in to fill the space and give the viewer a better idea of who I am. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image five" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/finalish-product.png" alt="The final-ish design for my coverpage. It probably looks a little differnt because I am always tweaking my designs.">
      <h3 class="phototag">The final-ish design for my coverpage. It probably looks a little differnt because I am always tweaking my designs.</h3>
    </div>


    <div class= "words">
      <p>With that finished and a clear path for the rest of the site, I blocked out the rest of the pages and got to work. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image six" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/projects-page-draft.png" alt="The wireframe of my projects page.">
      <h3 class="phototag">Wireframe design of my "Projects" page, complete with a few notes.</h3>
    </div>


    <div class= "words">
      <p>This is normally the place where you showcase your final product, and it feels weird not to do it, so <a class="cheeky-link" href="../index.html">here<a> is a link to my website. </p>
