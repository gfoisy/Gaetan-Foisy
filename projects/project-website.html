      <p><strong class="initialWords">I decided to make a website.</strong></p>
        <p> I am barely literate with html, css and JS, but I had a secret weapon: the internet. Also, I have a friend who is an incredible web developer. Although, he probably doen't want any credit for helping me learn how to do this. Or be mentioned anywhere on any website I create...</p>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image one" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/original-idea.PNG" alt="Image of the first draft of my website">
      <h3 class="phototag">The original idea and layout of my site.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>Originally, the idea behind my site was completely different. I liked this picture and though it would be a good starting point for my design. It made a decent first page, but I didn’t like where it led me when I was trying to come up with ideas for the other pages. Ie: I had no ideas for the other pages. </p>
      <p>I decided that I would redo my site and move away from having a single image as my background. It didn’t scale well and I ended up having to jump through a lot of hoops in order to get something I was ok with. Instead, I decided I should put a model of my 3d printer (CR10) on the first page, but not use it as the background. I am a big fan of 3d printing, and I wanted to use this page to show off my 3D modeling talent. </p>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image two" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/3dprinter-draft.jpg" alt="Image of the wireframe of my new website idea with a portion of a 3d printer visable">
      <h3 class="phototag">Blocking out the spacing of my home page. The printer was originally going to be animated.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>Fun fact: In an earlier draft of my site, the printer would move across the screen and “print” if you scrolled up or down. This was achieved with a few dozen clever div elements and way too much time. I ended up scrapping the idea because it refused to scale well and quickly became a timesink.</p>
      <br>

    </div>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image three" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/color-choice.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the color pallete I used.">
      <h3 class="phototag">Botanical Hues from design-seeds.com</h3>
    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>Now that I had my base geometry down, I needed a color pallet to work with. I am pretty bad with colors, but my friend gave me a few good site recommendations where I eventually found a pallet that fit.  </p>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image wholeprinter" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/full-printer.jpg" alt="An image of the CAD model of my printer.">
      <h3 class="phototag">CAD model of my 3D printer</h3>
    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>I actually modeled most of my printer before I decided to only use the head of it for my “logo”. I was in the process of designing an enclosure for my printer and I used this model for accurately measuring clearances, so the extra work didn't go to waste.</p>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>Now, all I had to do was export it Blender and set it up for rendering.</p>
      <br>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image finalrender" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/Untextured.jpg" alt="Image of an untextured logo.">
      <h3 class="phototag">An untextured version of my final logo.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class= "words">
      <p>With that finished, I put the assets into my site, and it really started to come together. After finishing the first page, I realized that I had too much empty space, so I rendered some of my other projects and put them in to fill the space and give the viewer a better idea of who I am. </p>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image five" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/finalish-product.jpg" alt="The final-ish design for my coverpage. It probably looks a little differnt because I am always tweaking my designs.">
      <h3 class="phototag">The final-ish design for my coverpage.</h3>
    </div>


    <div class= "words">
      <p>With the cover page mostly completed and a clear path for the rest of the site, I began blocking out the rest of the pages and got to work coding. </p>
      <br>

    <div class="photo">
      <img class="image six" src="../assets/Projects/website-itself/projects-page-draft.jpg" alt="The wireframe of my projects page.">
      <h3 class="phototag">Wireframe design of my "Projects" page, complete with a few notes.</h3>
    </div>


    <div class= "words">
      <p>This is normally the place where you showcase your final product, and it feels weird not to do it, so <a class="cheeky-link" href="../index.html">here<a> is a link to my website. </p>
