          This was a design I found online, so I will keep it brief. This was my introduction to the world of building keyboards and most of the difficulty for me was the volume of solder joints and learning how to build the firmware for the machine.

          The unique thing I did in this design was 3D printing everything, even the keycaps. I had just gotten a cheap resin printer online, and when I have a new toy, I find any excuse I can to use it! I ended up dying a clear resin with a deep transparent blue. After printing, I painted the lettering, cleaned it up, and finished things off with a few layers of clear coat. When I was done, my aficionado friend called me a monster. (“The switches aren’t even lubricated and ...well... just look at it!”)

          My next board was one that I designed entirely myself. This time I didn’t print the keycaps, but I did have to contend with the limits of my printer’s volume.

          Again, my friend wasn’t a fan of this board from an aesthetic or keyboard rigidity standpoint. I can’t disagree that cutting the keyboard down the middle makes it less rigid (and 3D printing if for that matter). However, I can’t tell the different between this and “rigid” boards so it still meets the requirements specified by the end user, me. Also, I thought it looked pretty cool. I still think it looks pretty cool.

          For my most recent board, I wanted to do something about my spaghetti wiring so I learned how to use KiCad and got some proper PCBs made with JLCPCB.

          I also updated the design to a simpler case – aesthetically and from a design standpoint. And apparently my friend was right about the mushy feeling of my last keyboard. I was using it as my daily driver at work and it was slowly driving me crazy! With a stiff PCB backing the keys and a short load path to the table, this board is much more rigid than the last and has been my daily driver ever since!
